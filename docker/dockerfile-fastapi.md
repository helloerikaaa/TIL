# Dockerfile for FastAPI Application

The following Dockerfile serves as a template for containerizing a FastAPI application, ensuring reproducibility and portability of the environment. Each section of the Dockerfile is accompanied by a brief explanation:

```bash
# pull official base image
FROM python:3.x

# set working directory
RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/app
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# set environment variables
ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE 1
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1

# install system dependencies
RUN apt-get update \
  && apt-get -y install netcat gcc \
  && apt-get clean

# install Python dependencies
RUN pip install --upgrade pip
COPY Pipfile Pipfile.lock ./
RUN pip install pipenv && pipenv install --dev --system --deploy

# add app
COPY . .
```
- Base Image: The Dockerfile starts by pulling the official Python 3.x slim image as a base.

- Working Directory: Sets the working directory within the container to `/usr/src/app`.
- Environment Variables: Defines environment variables to enhance Python's behavior within the container, ensuring cleaner and unbuffered execution.

- System Dependencies: Installs system-level dependencies, including `netcat` and `gcc`, necessary for certain Python packages.

- Python Dependencies: Upgrades pip, copies `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock`, installs pipenv, and then installs project dependencies using pipenv. The `--dev` `--system` `--deploy` flags ensure a production-ready installation.

- Add App: Copies the entire application into the container.


This Dockerfile encapsulates the necessary steps for creating a containerized FastAPI application, incorporating best practices for dependency management and environment configuration.
