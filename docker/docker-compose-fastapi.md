# Docker Compose File for FastAPI Application

The following Docker Compose file orchestrates the deployment of a FastAPI application using Docker. It specifies services, build configurations, runtime commands, volumes, and port mappings. Each section of the Docker Compose file is accompanied by a brief explanation:

```bash
version: '3.x'

services:
  api:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    command: uvicorn app.main:app --reload --workers 1 --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
    volumes:
      - .:/usr/src/app
    ports:
      - 8000:8000
```
- Version: Specifies the version of the Docker Compose file format.

- Services: Defines a single service named `api` for the FastAPI application.

- Build Configuration: Specifies the build context as the current directory (.) and the Dockerfile to be used (Dockerfile).

- Command: Specifies the runtime command for the `api` service, invoking uvicorn to run the FastAPI application with specified options such as reload, number of workers, host, and port.

- Volumes: Mounts the current directory (.) to `/usr/src/app` within the container. This enables live code reloading during development.

- Ports: Maps port `8000` on the host to port `8000` on the container, allowing external access to the FastAPI application.


This Docker Compose file simplifies the deployment and management of the FastAPI application, providing a standardized and reproducible environment.
