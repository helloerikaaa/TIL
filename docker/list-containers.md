# Docker PS Command

The docker ps command is instrumental in monitoring and managing Docker containers on a local machine. The basic syntax for this command is as follows:

```bash
docker ps
```
This command, without additional flags, displays an overview of the active Docker containers, showcasing relevant details such as container ID, image used, command executed, creation time, and current status.

**Note**: To include all containers, including those that have exited, the `-a` flag can be added (`docker ps -a`).
